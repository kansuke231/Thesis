The goal is to characterize the structural diversity of all real-world networks,
 and to investigate the degree to which networks from different sources are distinguishable, 
 based on their structure alone. If networks are distinguishable based on their structural patterns, 
 then networks from different sources that are never-the-less easily confused, structurally,
  may indicate common underlying constraints or generative processes that produce similar structural patterns. 



  A number of studies in network classification have only focused on structural features that make networks distinguishable from others and/or finding “super-families” of networks.
 There is no study investigating the relationship among network categories/domains.
	 E.g. How much are social networks different from brain networks?
		    How much are digital circuits different from brain networks?
                 Which categories of networks are drastically different from each other?
